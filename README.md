That means that one application was build, and using the vue part to display the information and the laravel part to retrieve it.
Once php7.4, composer, laravel 8, node.js, npm and vue.js are installed, as well as the projects were created on your machine, launch both servers and you'll be able to use them at once in the vue project server port.
